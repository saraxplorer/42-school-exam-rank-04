Assignment name  : tree_size
Expected files   : *.c
Allowed functions: None
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a function that calculates the size of a binary tree. The size of a tree 
is defined as the total number of nodes in the tree, including the root.

The function must be declared as follows:

    int tree_size(t_tree *tree);

Where `t_tree` is defined as:

    typedef struct s_tree
    {
        int value;
        struct s_tree *left;
        struct s_tree *right;
    } t_tree;

- If the tree is empty (i.e., `tree` is `NULL`), the function should return `0`.
- Otherwise, it should return the total number of nodes in the tree.

Examples:

Input tree:
        1
       / \
      2   3
