--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement a function that calculates the height of a binary tree. The height of a binary tree is the number of nodes on the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.

If the root node is NULL, the function should return 0.

The function should be declared as follows:

int    height_binary_tree(t_btree *root);

You have to use the ft_btree.h file, which will ONLY contain: 

    typedef struct s_btree
    {
        int value;
        struct s_btree *left;
        struct s_btree *right;
    } t_btree;
