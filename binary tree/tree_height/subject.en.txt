Assignment name  : tree_height

Allowed functions: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a function that calculates the height of a binary tree.

The tree structure is defined as follows:

    typedef struct s_tree
    {
        int value;
        struct s_tree *left;
        struct s_tree *right;
    } t_tree;

Function prototype:

    int height(t_tree *tree);

The `height` function should return the height of the binary tree, which is the longest path from the root to a leaf node.
