Assignment name  : find_number_in_tree
Expected files   : *.c
Allowed functions: write
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a function that searches for a number in a binary search tree (BST).

The tree structure is defined as follows:

    typedef struct s_tree
    {
        int value;
        struct s_tree *left;
        struct s_tree *right;
    } t_tree;

Function prototype:

    t_tree *find_num(t_tree *tree, int num);

Your function should return a pointer to the node containing the value `num`, 
if the node is found in the tree. If the value is not found, return `NULL`.
